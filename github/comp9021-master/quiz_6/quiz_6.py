# COMP9021 19T3 - Rachid Hamadi
# Quiz 6 *** Due Thursday Week 8
#
# Randomly fills an array of size 10x10 with 0s and 1s, and outputs the size of
# the largest parallelogram with horizontal sides.
# A parallelogram consists of a line with at least 2 consecutive 1s,
# with below at least one line with the same number of consecutive 1s,
# all those lines being aligned vertically in which case the parallelogram
# is actually a rectangle, e.g.
#      111
#      111
#      111
#      111
# or consecutive lines move to the left by one position, e.g.
#      111
#     111
#    111
#   111
# or consecutive lines move to the right by one position, e.g.
#      111
#       111
#        111
#         111
