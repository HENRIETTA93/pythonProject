#
# Prompts the user for an arity (a natural number) n and a word.
# Call symbol a word consisting of nothing but alphabetic characters
# and underscores.
# Checks that the word is valid, in that it satisfies the following
# inductive definition: a word of the form $s(w_1,...,w_n)$ with $s$
# denoting a symbol and  $w_1$, ..., $w_n$ denoting either valid words
# or symbols, with spaces allowed at both ends and around parentheses
# and commas, is a valid word (as a particular case, when $n=0$,
# a word is valid iff it is a symbol).

    # by removing all spaces and replacing all symbols with X.
