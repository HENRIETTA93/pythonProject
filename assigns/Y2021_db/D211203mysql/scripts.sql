--e.	List the school and salary information for these NJ schools:  Fairleigh Dickinson University, Princeton University, Rider University, Rutgers University, Seton Hall University, Stevens Institute of Technology in ascending order by school.  Use FORMAT and CONCAT to create a string for the salary that has a starting $ and a comma after the thousands place, for example:  $49,200.00 .  The salary columns in the result should be named starting_median, mid_career_median, and mid_career_90.  (10 points)

--f.	List the degree and starting median salary in descending order by median salary for degrees about information, marketing, accounting, finance, or business.  Use FORMAT and CONCAT to create a string for the salary that has a starting $ and a comma after the thousands place, for example:  $49,200.00 .

--g.	What schools in the Big Ten have a higher median starting salary than the median starting salary of Management Information Systems (MIS), and what are their median starting salaries?  Format the starting salaries with a starting $ and a comma after the thousands place in a result column called starting_median.  List the schools in the answer in descending order by median starting salary.  (10 points)

--h.	What are the schools, conferences, regions and starting median salaries for schools that  do not have a median mid-career salary listed for the 90th percentile?  Format the starting salaries with a starting $ and a comma after the thousands place, and call the column starting_median in the result.  Also include a column called both_mid_career_unknown which should be set to True if both the mid-career median and the mid-career 90th percentile are set to null and False otherwise. Sort the result in ascending order by conference and then school.  (10 points)

--i.	What is the name, median starting salary, median mid-career salary, and percentage increase from median starting to median mid-career salary for the school(s) with the highest percentage increase?  Calculate the percentage increase as ((mid_career_median â€“ starting_median)/starting_median)*100.  Round the percentage increase to the nearest integer and add a % symbol to the end.  The column with the percentage increase should be called percent_incr. (10 points).
