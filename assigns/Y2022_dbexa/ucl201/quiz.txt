Which of the following is/are the benefits when using a repository model?

(select all correct answers)

Group of answer choices

Sub-systems must agree on the data model.

Sub-systems producing data need not be concerned with how that data is used by other sub-systems.

Databases are an efficient way to share large amounts of data and data does not have to be transformed between different sub-systems (they agree on a single data representation).

Backups can be controlled by a single repository manager.

The data model is visible through the repository schema.
