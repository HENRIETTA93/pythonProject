Perfect numbers
A number is perfect if it is equal to the sum of its divisors, itself excluded. For instance, the divisors of 28 distinct from 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7 and 14, and 1+2+4+7+14=28, hence 28 is perfect.

Insert your code into perfect.py. The program prompts the user for an integer N. If the input is incorrect then the program outputs an error message and exits. Otherwise the program outputs all perfect numbers at most equal to N. Implement a naive solution, of quadratic complexity, so it can deal with small values of N only. Execute your program and check your outputs against the expected outputs with the Run and Mark (or Submit) buttons, respectively.

See Perfect number and  List of perfect numbers (from Wikipedia) for more details.
