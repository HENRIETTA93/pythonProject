Question 7
You can assume that i and j are both between 0 and 9 included. 
i is the row number (indexed from top to bottom), j is the column number (indexed from left to right) of the displayed grid.

Here are some execution examples:

    >>> area(0, 1, 5, 5)
    The grid is:
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    The area of the largest empty region of the grid
    containing the point (5, 5) is: 0
    
    >>> area(0, 1000, 5, 5)
    The grid is:
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

    The area of the largest empty region of the grid
    containing the point (5, 5) is: 100
    
    >>> area(0, 3, 6, 2)
