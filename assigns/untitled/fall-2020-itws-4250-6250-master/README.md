This repository will contain the [syllabus](syllabus.md), [schedule](schedule.md), class notes (including code snippets), homework assignments for the Fall 2020 ITWS 4250/6250 Database Systems course at RPI.

## Announcements

**Wednesday October 14** Due to the number of questions, as well as some Submitty issues, I'm extending the deadline for homework 3 until this Friday October 16, at 11:59PM (23:59:59).

**Wednesday October 7, 5:45PM** I still have no power, so there will be no scheduled lecture this week. I will provide recorded lectures for the scheduled content this week as soon as I'm able.

There will be no Lab this week.

**Wednesday October 7, 4:35PM** I have no power and no estimate on when it will be restored (it's generally pretty quick). As of now, class is delayed until 6:10PM this evening. Please check back (or check Slack) at 5:45PM to find out if we're having half the lecture.

**Saturday October 3** [Homework 3](homework/homework-3/homework-3.pdf) is now available.

**Tuesday September 22** Due to a family emergency, there will be a few changes to the schedule this week:
- There will be no lecture this week (class will not meet for the Wednesday September 23 WebEx lecture),
- There will be no regularly schedule office hours on Thursday September 24. Please don't hesitate to ask questions related to the homework on Slack, but answers may not be as prompt as usual.
- Homework 2, originally due this Friday will now be due Wednesday September 30 **at 16:45 New York time**.

I will attempt to record a lecture segment for you to watch before the next class, so that we don't fall too far behind.

I will also attempt to record an explanation of the Final Project. The Final Project Memo that would have been due next week will now be due October 7 before class.

**Tuesday September 1** Announcements will be posted here as needed.

### Welcome

Welcome to ITWS 4250/6250 Database Applications and Systems. Take some time to read through the [syllabus](syllabus.md).

## Git

As you've noticed, rather than a traditional website, this course uses a git repository. The goal is both to make it easy for you to retrieve correct copies of sample code and homework (much of which will involve runnable code) and to help you become familiar with a tool that's widely used in both academia and industry. 

If you're not familiar with git, take an hour and familiarize yourself with it. There are some good resources [here](https://try.github.io/). *This isn't a requirement&mdash;it will be possible to successfully complete this course without a working knowledge of git. But you'll need to learn it eventually anyway, so why not now?*

### Git-related course policies

One of the side effects of using git is that it becomes easy for students to help correct errors (or make suggestions) in any of the content hosted here. If you find an error (typo, bug, other mistake, etc.), feel free to fork the repository, and make a pull request (I believe GitLab calls it a "merge request").

Some homework assignments or sample code will become visible in branches throughout the semester before it's technically assigned. If it's in the repo, feel free to look at it. But until I merge it into the `master` branch, everything is still subject to change without notice. If you start a homework assignment early, be sure to check back for changes (which git makes easy to do).
