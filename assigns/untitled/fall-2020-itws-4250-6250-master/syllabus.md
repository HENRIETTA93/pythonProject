## Prerequisites

This course will involve a good amount of programming. It requires a good working knowledge of data structures and algorithms, and proficiency in a higher-level programming language (e.g., C++ or Python (equivalent of CSCI-2300)). Homework assignments that require programming not covered in class will be in Python. No prior knowledge of database management systems is assumed. 

## Instructors

### Professor

Samuel B. Johnson

johnss20 \[at\] rpi \[dot\] edu

Office hours:
- Thursday afternoons from 4:30-6:30
- By appointment

Office hours will be "held" via the Office Hours Queue feature of Submitty. You can add your name and contact information to the queue if you have a question you wish to discuss, and I'll reach out to you individually. If it seems that a number of students are likely to have similar questions, I'll host a WebEx meeting that students can join. **This approach is subject to change if it isn't working well given the remote format for the course**.

## Course Goals and Objectives

By the conclusion of this course, students should have learned the following:

- Be able to apply principles of normalization to design a data model that leads to the development of high performance data-intensive applications. Students taking the course for graduate credit will be expected to demonstrate this knowledge at a higher level of complexity.
- Be able to write correct and efficient code that implements application logic for high throughput data operations.
- Understand how a database management system integrates into a larger application architecture.
- Have a solid understanding of a variety of database paradigms, and a good idea of when each is appropriate. Students taking the course for graduate credit will be expected to build on their understanding of database paradigms to use multiple paradigms appropriately in an application.

### Technology

Throughout the semester, we will make use of several different technologies related to database systems and their use in software applications. You will need to install and run some of them in a development environment of your choice (typically your laptop) to be able to complete many of the assignments effectively. Students are encouraged to help each other with the install process, and suggested times to do so will be noted in the course schedule so that you have the appropriate development environment set up ahead of when you need it.

## Assessment Measures and Grading Criteria

This is a programming-intensive course, so a majority of your grade will be determined by your work on a number of individual programming assignments, and a final team project. In addition to programming assignments, there will be written (short-answer) homework assignments, a number of lab assignments (generally done during the scheduled lecture period), and a comprehensive final exam.

Your grade will be determined as follows:

- Homework (40%). There will be six homework assignments given throughout the semester. Two will be written, the others will involve some element of programming. The percentage of your grade will vary, but homework will make up forty percent of your final grade. 
- Labs (20%). There will be between four and eight "lab" assignments that may be done collaboratively. The lab assignments will typically occur during the scheduled lecture period (though they won't be due until the following day) to allow students to practice content covered in the lecture. Each lab will make up an equal portion of the 20%, and the lowest quiz grade will be dropped.
- Final Exam (10%). There will be a single exam given at the end of the semester, including both a written and "practical" (programming) section, worth 10 percent of your grade.
- Final Project (30%). There will be one final project, to be done either individually or in teams of two and presented on the last day of class. For students taking the course for graduate credit, there will be an additional requirement to this project, beyond what is expected of undergraduates.

## Texts

The course will rely extensively on **Database Systems The Complete Book (2nd Edition)** by Hector Garcia-Molina, Jeffrey D. Ullman, and Jennifer Widom. ISBN: 0131873253, Prentice Hall.

Additional readings will be assigned from a number of other online sources. All will be either freely available, or available for free to the RPI community.

## Communication

There is a [Slack team](https://itws-databases-f20.slack.com) for the course. Students are encouraged to use this as the primary means of communication between each other and with the instructor, including any questions related to the course material.

We'll also be using [Submitty](https://submitty.cs.rpi.edu/courses/f20/itws4250) this semester for submitting assignments. There's a forums feature there, and you're encouraged to try using that as well, particularly for questions related to assignments.

If there's something you don't feel comfortable sharing in slack, the instructor is available by email, or you can always stop by office hours or set up an appointment.

## Other Course Policies

You are expected to communicate to the instructor any issue regarding your performance in the class ahead of time. This includes late homeworks, inability to perform an assigned task, problems with your team members, etc. You should be prepared to provide sufficient proof of any circumstances on which you are making a special request as outlined in the Rensselaer Handbook of Student Rights and Responsibilities. Please don't hesitate to raise any concerns that you anticipate arising due to your particular situation given the ongoing COVID epidemic. I understand that it may be a challenging semester for you in a number of different ways. My primary goal is for you to learn the course material, and I want to do everything I can in that respect, but I can't solve problems of which I'm not aware. 

### Attendence

Attendence is not required, though it is highly encouraged. Students are accountable for all material taught throughout the semester, and being absent when the material was covered is not an acceptable excuse for not knowing it. 

### Late Policy

Late assignments create an extra burden on the instructor and delay the discussion of the solutions in class. Homework assignments must be submitted electronically by the deadline, as measured by our computers. Assignments that are a minute late are considered a day late! Each student will be given a total of five days (whole or partial) of grace for late assignments for the whole semester. No more than three may be used on any given assignment. These late days should be used carefully. Once the late days have been exhausted, late assignments may not be accepted without a written excuse from the Student Experience office.

### Grade Appeal Policy

If you disagree with the grading on an assignment, you should appeal to the instructor. Appeals must be made within one week after the specific grade is returned.

### Taking Exams

The final exam will be in a take-home format (essentially a more significant homework assignment). You are expected to complete it individually, just as you would an in-class exam. You will be allowed to use any resources that would typically be available for homework assignments (textbooks, notes, [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com), etc.), but the work that you submit on the exam should be your own.

## Academic Integrity

Student-teacher relationships are built on trust. For example, students must trust that teachers have made appropriate decisions about the structure and content of the courses they teach, and teachers must trust that the assignments that students turn in are their own. Acts that violate this trust undermine the educational process. The Rensselaer Handbook of Student Rights and Responsibilities defines various forms of Academic Dishonesty and you should make yourself familiar with these. In this class, all assignments that are turned in for a grade must represent the studentâ€™s own work. In cases where help was received, or teamwork was allowed, a notation on the assignment should indicate your collaboration.

Cheating and Academic Dishonesty will not be tolerated. All your coursework should provide an honest effort in solving the assigned problem by yourself (and by your group partners for group assignments). You are allowed to work with other students in designing algorithms, in interpreting error messages, in discussing strategies for finding bugs, but NOT in writing code or writing down solutions. Even if you discuss the problems with other students (or other teams), you should write down your own solution or program when turning in an assignment.

You may not share, copy, or discuss in detail code or solutions while writing it or afterwards. You may not show your code or solutions to other students as a means of helping them. You may not leave online, printed copies or drafts of your solutions in publicly accessible areas, such as labs, workstations, dorms, etc. You may not post complete or partial answers to homeworks in any public forum, especially on Slack before the due date to make sure all students had a chance to work on the problems on their own.

All cases of cheating will be punished and reported to the Dean of Students. You will receive a grade of zero if you cheat on a homework. A second instance of cheating on a homework or any cheating in the exam will result in an F grade in this course. If you have any question concerning this policy before submitting an assignment, please ask for clarification. There may be changes to the policies, deadlines and list of topics described in the syllabus. You can expect me to give you reasonable notice of any changes. All changes will be announced in class.
