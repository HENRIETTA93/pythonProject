# SQL

## Example Setup

You can follow the instructions [here](../examples/db-setup.md) to set up an example database with some data in it for the purposes of following along.

## Introduction

We saw part of SQL back in chapter 2: that focused on the Data Definition Language part of it.

SQL also supports Querying and Modifying the data: "Data Manipulation Language"

## Simple Queries in SQL

Most basic queries ask for tuples of some relation that satisfy a basic condition

`SELECT * FROM relation WHERE condition`

`FROM` clause specifies the relation

`WHERE` clause defines a condition (similar to the selection operator)

`SELECT` clause specifies which attributes (similar to projection operator)

Useful when examining a query to start with the FROM clause, then look at the WHERE clause, and finally the SELECT

```postgresql
SELECT name, time, location
FROM course
WHERE semester='F20';

```

### Projection in SQL 

We use the SELECT keyword to accomplish projection

Use `*` or define a list of attributes

Note that this includes the extended projection operator

- `SELECT x AS y` 
- `SELECT 'constant'`
- `SELECT 'string' || 'concatenation'`

```postgresql
SELECT semester || ' ' || name AS full_course
FROM course;

SELECT 
FROM course;

```

### Selection in SQL

The selection operator is available via the WHERE clause

Six comparison operators: `= <> < > <= >=`

Values are constants and attributes from the relations mentioned in the FROM clause

Arithmetic operators: `+ - * / ()`

String concatenation: `||`

Result of a comparison is a boolean `TRUE` or `FALSE` (or `UNKNOWN`)

Can combine with `AND` `OR`, and `NOT` 

Strings are compared and matched exactly 

Padding (from fixed length fields) is ignored

Comparison `< >`  is done using lexicographic order 

#### Pattern Matching in SQL

Exact matches for strings are pretty limited 

SQL allows for Pattern Matching

`s LIKE P` where s is a string, and P is a pattern

`%` wildcard matches any number of characters (like .* in regular expressions)
`_` wildcard matches any single character (like . in regex)

`s NOT LIKE P` does the inverse

```postgresql
SELECT *
FROM course
WHERE name ILIKE '%systems%';

```

#### Escape Characters

How do we match the character `%` or `_` in our string?

There's no escape character like \ in c or python

We can choose any character as the escape:

`s LIKE 'xx%%xx%' ESCAPE 'xx'`

`xx%abc%`
`%abc%`


#### Dates and Times

`DATE'YYYY-MM-DD'` is the standard date format 

`TIME'HH:MM:SS.sss'` is the standard time format

Optionally add a timezone after the time `-X:XX`

We can combine date and time to form a timestamp (or datetime)

Some implementations use `DATETIME` instead, and the `TIMESTAMP` fields are auto-updated to `now()` when their tuple is updated

Postgres also has `INTERVAL` type for comparison

```postgresql
SELECT *
FROM enroll
WHERE registered < '2020-08-31';

```

### NULL values in SQL

There are many reasons to support the concept of NULL
- SQL outer joins produce null values
- Certain INSERT operations produce null values

- Value unknown (birthday)
- Value inapplicable (spouse for a single person)
- Value withheld (unlisted phone number/credit card data)

Two important rules to remember when operating on potentially NULL values:
- When we operate on a NULL using arithmetic operators, the result is NULL
- When we compare a NULL to any other value (including another NULL), the result is `UNKNOWN`

NULL may appear as a value, but we can't operate on it as such

To check for NULL: `x IS NULL` or `x IS NOT NULL` (`x=NULL` will not do what you think)

#### Truth values of UNKNOWN 

Helpful to think of:
- TRUE = 1
- UNKNOWN = 1/2
- FALSE = 0

`AND` of any two values is the minimum

`OR` of any two values is the maximum

`NOT` of any value is `1 - value` 

### Ordering Output

We can specify `ORDER BY <attributes>` to sort the output

Defaults to `ASC` (ascending order), but we can use `DESC`

```postgresql
SELECT *
FROM course
WHERE semester like 'S__'
ORDER BY semester DESC, location;

SELECT name
FROM course
WHERE semester like 'S__'
ORDER BY semester DESC, capacity / 3;

```

The sorting is done after the `FROM` and `WHERE`, before the SELECT

That means that all attributes are available for use in ordering, not just attributes in the SELECT

We can also specify expressions, not just attributes

## Data Modification

So far, we've considered SQL statements that return tuples

There are others that allow modification of the data

### Insertion

The basic form is `INSERT INTO relation(attributes) VALUES (values)`

```postgresql
INSERT INTO course(name, semester, time, location, capacity) 
VALUES ('Advanced Databases', 'S21', 'T8-10', 'DCC 337', 10);

SELECT * FROM course;
```

The list of attributes is technically optional 

```postgresql
INSERT INTO course 
VALUES ('Remedial Databases', 'S21', 'T12-2', 'Lally 102', 10);

INSERT INTO course 
VALUES ('Remedial Databases 2', 'S20', 'LOW 3039', 'F12-2', 50);

INSERT INTO course(name, semester, location, time, capacity) 
VALUES ('Remedial Databases 3', 'F20', 'LOW 3039', 'F12-2', 50);

INSERT INTO course(name, semester, location, time) 
VALUES ('Remedial Databases 4', 'F20', 'LOW 3039', 'F12-2');
```


If we don't specify values for all attributes, the default will be used 

### Updates

`UPDATE relation SET attribute=value WHERE condition`

```postgresql
UPDATE course
SET location = 'Lally 104'
WHERE semester='S21' AND name = 'Remedial Databases';
```

### Deletion

`DELETE FROM relation WHERE condition`

```postgresql
DELETE FROM course
WHERE name ilike '%remedial%';
```




## Queries involving more than one relation

Much of the power of relational algebra comes from being able to combine two or more relations.

We can do the same in SQL

### Products and Joins

The simplest is the list multiple relations in the FROM clause

Effectively gives us the Cartesian product

The WHERE clause gives us a theta-join

```postgresql
SELECT *
FROM course, enroll
WHERE course.name = enroll.course_name
AND course.semester = enroll.semester;
```

#### Disambiguating attributes

As with relational algebra, we prepend the relation name and a dot to disambiguate

### Tuple Variables

Sometimes we want to use the same relation multiple times in the FROM clause 

We disambiguate by using a "tuple variable"

Each use of R in the FROM clause is followed by a variable name that will be used to reference that instance elsewhere in the query

Example: students with the same major

```postgresql
SELECT s1.name
FROM student s1, student s2
WHERE s1.major = s2.major
AND s1.email <> s2.email;

SELECT * FROM student;
```



## Interpreting multi-relation queries

There are a few ways we can think of the select-from-where expressions 

First is Nested Loops: each tuple variable loops over the entire relation

Multiple relations give nested loops:

``` 
for tuple c in course
    for tuple e in enroll
        if where clause
            print (c, e)
```

Another is Parallel Assignment: rather than nested loops, we consider, in parallel, all possibles values from the tuple variables, and evaulate the WHERE for each 

Conversion to Relational Algebra:

Start with relations from the tuple variables, take cartesian product, and apply the where clause

Assume relations R, S, and T 

We want to find R ∩ (S ∪ T)

In SQL: `SELECT R.a FROM R, S, T WHERE R.a = S.a OR R.a = T.a`

Consider what happens if T is empty?

Nested Loops:

``` 
for tuple r in R
    for tuple s in S
        for tuple t in T
            if r.a = s.a OR r.a = t.a
                print (r.a)
```

Parallel assignment: no assigment is possible, because there's nothing in T

Relational algebra: σ R.a = S.a OR R.a = T.a (R×S×T)

but R×S×T is empty

## Joins in SQL

SQL supports a number of variants on the JOIN operator: products, natural joins, theta joins, outer joins

More conventional theta-join is: 

``` 
SELECT *
FROM R JOIN S ON (condition)

```

There are also OUTER, LEFT, RIGHT variants

``` 
SELECT *
FROM R LEFT JOIN S ON (condition)

```

## Set Operations

`UNION`, `INTERSECT`, `EXCEPT`

The two select statements must produce the same number of attributes and the corresponding datatypes must be compatible 

``` 
(SELECT a, b FROM r)
UNION
(SELECT a, b FROM s);

```

Postgres also allows `UNION ALL` (intersect and except as well), which doesn't remove duplicates. (Considerably faster)

## Subqueries

A query can be used in various ways to help in the evaluation of another (called a subquery)

Set operations are one example

There are others:
1. Subquery that returns a single constant, which can be compared with another constant in the WHERE clause
2. Subquery that returns a relation, that can be used in various ways in the WHERE clause
3. Subqueries can appear in the FROM clause, followed by a tuple variable 

### Subqueries that produce scalar values

An atomic value that can appear as one component of a tuple is called a *scalar*

A SELECT-FROM-WHERE query can produce any number of attributes

We often only care about one attribute

Using keys, we can limit the result to a single tuple 

We can use that kind of query, surrounded by parentheses, as if it were a constant/scalar value

Example: write a query to find all students who took a class last semester that's in the same room as database systems this semester:

```postgresql
SELECT student_email 
FROM enroll, course 
WHERE enroll.semester = course.semester 
AND location = (
    SELECT location
    FROM course
    WHERE name = 'Database Applications and Systems'
    AND semester = 'F20'
);
```

### Subqeries involving relations

There are SQL operators we can apply to a relation R and produce a boolean result

R must be expressed as a subquery (`SELECT * FROM R` will stand for the whole relation)

1. `EXISTS R`: return true if R is not empty
2. `s IN R`: returns true if s is equal to one of the values in r
    - also `s NOT IN R`
3. `s > ALL R`: returns true if s is greater than all the values in r 
    - also have other comparison operators
4. `s > ANY R`: returns true if s is greater than any of the values in r
    - also have other comparison operators

```postgresql
SELECT student_email
FROM enroll, course
WHERE enroll.course_name = course.name 
AND enroll.semester = course.semester
AND location IN (
    SELECT location
    FROM course
    WHERE name = 'Database Systems'
);

SELECT *
FROM course
WHERE capacity > ALL (
    SELECT capacity
    FROM course
    WHERE name = 'Database Systems'
)
```


### Conditions involving tuples

A tuple in SQL is represented as a parenthesized list of scalar values

If tuple t has the same number (and type) of components as the relation R, then we can compare t to R using the operators above

Example: find everyone taking a course in the DCC

```postgresql
SELECT student_email
FROM enroll
WHERE (course_name, semester) IN (
    SELECT name, semester
    FROM course
    WHERE location like 'DCC%'
);
```

Note that order of attributes is assumed

Many queries written with subqueries can be rewritten using multiple relations in the FROM clause

### Correlated Subqueries

In the simplest nested queries, the subquery is evaluated once, and the result is used in the containing query.

More complicated queries require the subquery to be evaluated once for each assignment of a value to some term that comes from a tuple variable outside the subquery

Example: We want to list all students who have failed an assignment

```postgresql
SELECT name
FROM student s
WHERE .6 > ANY (
    SELECT grade
    FROM grades
    WHERE student_email = s.email
);
```

### Scoping Rules

In general, an attribute is assumed to come from a relation in the FROM clause

If none exists, look in the surrounding query and so on

We can force the surrounding query to be used by using a dot and the tuple variable

### Subqueries in the FROM clause

We can also use subqueries as relations in the FROM clause

Surround them with parentheses. We're required to specify a tuple variable

```postgresql
SELECT name
FROM student, 
(SELECT student_email FROM grades WHERE grade < .6) failing_students
WHERE student.email = failing_students.student_email;

```


## Full Relation Operations 

Some operators act on full relations, rather than individual tuples 

### Duplicate Elimination

SQL doesn't remove duplicates by default 

Use `DISTINCT` keyword

`SELECT DISTINCT a, b, c FROM R WHERE ...`

Remember that duplicate elimination is a very expensive operation. Use it judiciously 

### Grouping and Aggregation

SQL supports the grouping operator from relational algebra

SQL supports the same five aggregator operators:
- SUM
- MIN
- MAX
- AVG
- COUNT

Usually apply them to scalar values, often an attribute in the SELECT clause

Exception is `COUNT(*)` which counts all the tuples in the relation generated by the FROM and WHERE clause 

We can eliminate duplicates in the column before the aggregation is done using the `DISTINCT` keyword

`SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT x)` will produce a count of the distinct values for attribute x 

Note `SELECT COUNT(X)` produces the same result as `SELECT COUNT(*)`, because the former will count duplicates 

For grouping, use the key words `GROUP BY <attributes>`

The list of attributes is only the grouping attributes 

The aggregated attributes appear in the SELECT clause

Only two kinds of attributes can appear in a SELECT clause once you have a `GROUP BY` clause:
1. Aggregations 
2. Attributes that appear in the `GROUP BY` list

There's no requirement to have both. We could just have aggregated attributes, or just grouping attributes

```postgresql
SELECT AVG(grade), course_name
FROM grades
GROUP BY course_name, semester;


```

We can have GROUP BY in a query involving multiple relations. The query is evaluated in this order:
1. Evaluate the relation R created by the FROM and WHERE clauses 
2. Group the tuples of R according to the attributes in the GROUP BY list
3. Produce the result specified in the SELECT clause as if R were a stored relation 

```postgresql
SELECT AVG(grade), student_email
FROM grades, student
WHERE grades.student_email = student.email
GROUP BY student_email;
```



#### Handling NULLS

- The "value" NULL is ignored in any aggregation, including `COUNT(a)` (`COUNT(*)` will still count all the tuples in the relation)
- `NULL` is treated as an ordinary value when it comes to building groups 
- When we perform any aggregation except count over an empty bag, the result is NULL
    - The count of an empty bag is 0

### `HAVING` clauses

What if we don't want to include every tuple in our grouping result?

One option is to restrict which tuples are included using the WHERE clause 

But sometimes we want to limit which groups appear based on the result of some aggregation 

Example: build a list of students with an average grade above 90%

```postgresql
SELECT student_email
FROM grades
WHERE grade > .6
GROUP BY student_email
HAVING AVG(grade) > .9 AND student_email ilike '%@rpi.edu';
```

We use `HAVING <condition>` to restrict which groups appear in the result

Several rules to remember:
- An aggregation in a HAVING clause applies only to the tuples in the group being tested
- Any attribute in a relation in the FROM clause may be aggregated in the HAVING clause, but only those attributes that appear in the GROUP BY list may appear unaggregated in the HAVING clause (same as the SELECT clause)

## One more note on INSERT

```postgresql
INSERT INTO course(name, semester, time, location, capacity)  
VALUES ('More Databases', 'S20', 'w8-10', 'DCC-337', 50);
```

We can use a subquery to insert more than one row at a time

```postgresql
INSERT INTO course(name, semester) VALUES ('Internet Security', 'F20');

INSERT INTO enroll(student_email, course_name, semester) 
SELECT email, 'Internet Security', 'F20'
FROM student
WHERE major = 'ITWS';

SELECT * FROM enroll;
```
