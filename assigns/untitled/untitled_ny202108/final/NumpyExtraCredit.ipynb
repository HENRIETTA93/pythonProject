    "In predictive modeling, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) can be used to measure performance of a model with a binary response variable (containing values 0 or 1 only), which attempts to predict the probability of an event (1) given a set of X characteristics. The goal of a model with such dependent variable is to assign high probabilities to examples with an actual '1' label and low probabilities to examples with an actual '0' label. You can read more about AUC here: \n",

    "\n",
    "While in general to compute area under a curve requires numerical approximation techniques such as trapezoid rule, another way to estimate this area is by observing the number of rows in the data set for which the predicted probabilities are close to the actual outcome. In particular, given a set of actual labels and the corresponding predicted probabilities, this estimate can be obtained by looking at all possible pairs of actual 1's and 0's and counting the number of pairs for which the predicted probability for the 1 actual label is higher than the predicted probability of the 0 actual label. The complete rule for estimating the area is to give a +1 when the predicted probability of an actual 1 exceeds the predicted probability of an actual 0; to give a 0 when the predicted probability of an actual 0 exceeds the predicted probability of an actual 1; and to give a 0.5 when the predicted probabilities of the actual outcome pair are equal. Then, these are added and divided by the total number of pairs to obtain the estimated area. The higher the number the more accurate our model is in correctly predicting the positive examples in the data. For example: let us consider 5 pairs of predicted probabilities where the first number in the pair corresponds to the actual 1 (Pr1) and the second number in the pair corresponds to the actual 0 (Pr0). Then,\n",
